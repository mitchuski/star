# HOLOSPACE.md — the Swordsman's Key as a holospace

This repo is packaged to be provisionable as a **holospace** — a bootable, κ-addressed
environment — over [Hologram-Technologies/holospaces](https://github.com/Hologram-Technologies/holospaces),
the UOR-native boot layer. A local reference copy of the upstream repo lives at
`holospaces/` (gitignored; it has its own upstream history).

The thesis of the integration: holospaces' first law — **identity is content, not
location** — is the Swordsman's thesis stated in substrate terms. A City Key already
travels as a self-describing artifact; the κ-label makes that identity verifiable
by re-derivation, anywhere.

## Vocabulary mapping

| holospaces (docs/12-Glossary.md) | the Swordsman's Key |
|---|---|
| **κ-label** — `<axis>:<hex>` = `H(canonical_form)`; identity of every thing (*what*, not *where*) | `kappa` field on every exported City Key — `sha256:<hex>` over the key's canonical form |
| **Canonical form** — deterministic bytes; the only form holospaces operates on | the key's JSON, keys sorted recursively, no whitespace, `kappa` excluded |
| **Operator** — self-sovereign identity that provisions and manages holospaces | the bearer — the First Person, reachable only via both agents |
| **holospace** — bootable κ-addressed environment | this repo booted: the walkable model (/star + /lattice) |
| **devcontainer holospace** — provisioned from a devcontainer | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (this repo's boot definition) |
| **κ snapshot** — running state as κ-addressed canonical form | an exported City Key: palette + descriptions + lit + trace + focus + witness, κ-stamped |
| **Projection** — a view + intent surface, never a second source of truth | /star and /lattice — two projections of one lattice ℒ, linked by BroadcastChannel |

## The Five Laws, as honoured here

1. **Content-based identity (no servers)** — the City Key's `kappa` is derived from
   its content; the pages are static and serverless.
2. **Canonical forms only** — `canonicalJSON()` (sorted keys, no whitespace) is the
   only form hashed; pretty-printing for humans never changes identity.
3. **The KappaStore as address space** — out of scope until substrate access (below);
   interim content addressing is an IPFS pin of the site bundle, matching the
   grimoire-pin practice.
4. **Substrate-exclusive operations** — n/a for the static projection.
5. **Re-derivation for verification** — on every City Key import, both pages
   recompute the κ-label and display `κ verified` / `⚠ κ mismatch`.

## The κ-label on a City Key

- Axis: **`sha256`** — per the upstream spec, a SHA-256 digest *is* a κ-label on the
  `sha256` axis (docs/13-Product-Security.md; CC-1 lists FIPS 180-4 SHA-2 among the
  σ-axis standards). `crypto.subtle` provides it natively in the browser.
- Canonical form: the key object with keys sorted recursively, serialized with no
  whitespace, the `kappa` field excluded (a label can't contain itself).
- Stamped at export by both pages; re-derived at import. Any edit to the key —
  a description, a lap of trace, a poured-focus witness — mints a different κ.
  That is the point: the key *is* its content.

```json
{
  "name": "city key",
  "version": 1,
  "palette": { "cool": "#141a3d", "warm": "#f0eee8", "sword": "#e8523a", "mage": "#4dd9e8" },
  "descriptions": { "0": "…" },
  "kappa": "sha256:…64 hex…"
}
```

**What the κ is and is not.** The `kappa` field is a *fingerprint*, not a
transformation: the key's content is untouched, byte for byte. The label is
computed FROM the content (hash of the canonical form) and appended as one extra
field. Delete it and the key still works everywhere; recompute it and you get the
same value back if — and only if — the content is unchanged. It is the key's
*name*, in the strict UOR sense: derived from what it is, not where it lives.
Consumers that don't know the field ignore it (verified against agentprivacy's
`parseCityKey`, which is lenient by design).

**Conformance test vector** (any implementation must reproduce this):
- Content: `{ name: "the default city key", version: 1, palette: {cool:"#141a3d",
  warm:"#f0eee8", sword:"#e8523a", mage:"#4dd9e8"}, descriptions: {"0": "The
  unguarded origin — no dimension held, fully legible.", "63": "Full sovereignty —
  all six dimensions held; the Swordsman’s reflection of the origin."} }`
  (the `/sigil` default key; note the U+2019 apostrophe and U+2014 dashes — the
  canonical form is UTF-8 of the JSON with keys sorted recursively, no whitespace,
  303 bytes)
- κ: **`sha256:0b4916babe5eb17104b342ab06030f2071a818024b345bf6d2e4115617c3c527`**
- Properties verified: key-order independence (same content in any insertion
  order → same κ); stamped round-trip (re-deriving over a κ-stamped key, with
  `kappa` excluded from its own preimage, reproduces the same κ).

## The sigil PNG carrier

`/sigil` exports the key's constellation as a PNG that **carries the key**: the
full City Key JSON, base64-encoded, in a PNG `tEXt` chunk (keyword `cityKey`)
inserted before `IEND`, with a correct CRC-32 — the image stays a valid PNG for
every viewer, and the κ caption is also visible in the pixels. All three pages
import the PNG as readily as the JSON (the import branches on the PNG signature).
The artifact is self-describing *and* self-carrying: share the picture, you have
shared the key.

## Boot

- **Today (any devcontainer tool / Codespaces):** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  boots the repo and serves the walkable model on port 8000. holospaces honours the
  same managed parameters (CC-4): `forwardPorts`, lifecycle commands, `containerEnv`,
  `features`.
- **Over holospaces (when operator access arrives):** a devcontainer holospace is
  provisioned from this repo + `devcontainer.json`; the OCI image and repo ingest as
  κ content (CC-10), and **same source ⇒ same holospace κ** — the repo itself becomes
  a content-addressed identity. Note the guest ISA (`riscv64` or `aarch64`) is part
  of that identity and fixed for the holospace's lifetime; the current base image is
  amd64/arm64, so provisioning under the System Emulator may need a riscv64-capable
  base — settle this with the operator key in hand.
- **Later (`.holo` compute artifact):** the lattice canon — `neg`, `bnot`,
  `succ = neg∘bnot` over ℤ/64ℤ — is a family of pure functions over a 64-point
  domain: exactly the shape the hologram substrate materializes into lookup tables.
  A `.holo` of the canon would make the Swordsman's Key a compute artifact, not just
  a site: the first holospace whose content *is* the sovereignty lattice.

## Status

- [x] κ-labelled City Keys (export-stamped, import-verified) — both pages
- [x] Devcontainer boot definition
- [ ] IPFS pin of the stripped site bundle (interim content addressing)
- [ ] Provision as a devcontainer holospace via the Platform Manager — **blocked on
  the third-party operator key** (the hologram substrate arrives via credentialed git)
- [ ] `.holo` artifact of the lattice canon
